                    <p>
                            Modern day Kappa Sigma was founded one chilly evening in the 
                            fall of 1869, as five students attending the University of Virginia 
                            in Charlottesville gathered in the room of William Grigsby McCormick, 
                            at 46 East Lawn, and planted the seed of Brotherhood. For many weeks 
                            the bonds of friendship had drawn these five together; now the need 
                            became clear for a formal structure to contain their feelings. Thus, 
                            not only did the Founders formalize their friendship, but they also 
                            created a fraternity steeped in the traditions of the past and dedicated 
                            to the Pursuit of Learning. The new brothers recorded their bond in a 
                            Constitution and in an Oath that set forth the ideals and principles to 
                            all Kappa Sigmas today.
                            <br> <br>
                            The Alpha Mu Chapter was established at the University of North 
                            Carolina in 1893. Its founding members were George Roscoe Little, 
                            Gerard Samuel Wittson, James Spenser Lewis, Thomas Pleasant Braswell,
                             Jr., and Thomas Menan Hooker. The fraternity stressed fellowship, 
                             leadership, scholarship, and service. Today, we still hold these 
                             values dearly at UNC and will continue to do so in the future.
